Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) is a suite of shared
libraries that enable the local system administrator to choose how
applications authenticate users.

In other words, without (rewriting and) recompiling a PAM-aware
application, it is possible to switch between the authentication mechanisms)
it uses. Indeed, one may entirely upgrade the local authentication system
without touching the applications themselves.

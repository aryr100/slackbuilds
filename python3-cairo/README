Python3-cairo is a Python 3.x binding for the Cairo graphics library.
The Pycairo bindings are designed to match the cairo C API as closely as
possible, and to deviate only in cases which are clearly better
implemented in a more 'Pythonic' way.

This requires python3.

Python3-cairo is safe to install beside Slackware's pycairo package (Python 2.7).
